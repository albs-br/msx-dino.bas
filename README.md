Attempt to recreate the famous Chrome browser Dino game on a 10-liner MSX-Basic program.

My entry to the cool BASIC 10-Liner Contest 2023 (entries [here](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/games-list-2023), results [here](https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/results-2023)).

It can be run on any MSX machine (all generations) or MSX emulator by loading the file "DiskImage.dsk".

Can also be run directly on any browser:

    https://msxpen.com/codes/-NR8-A7dx6l4xVtpQTxI (development version)

Commands:
- Just use spacebar to jump

Full explanation of code available in the file "code explained.bas"

Sprites were made with TinySprite. A backup file file is provided ("tinysprite_bkp.txt").
